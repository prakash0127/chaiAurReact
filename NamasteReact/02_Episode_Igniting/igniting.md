# Our code

as off now what we have written the code, is it, or can we move our code to production NO we can't because we have remove the comments that we can't sent to production and optimize our code and if we have images in our code we can make it otimize and settled together in such a folder

- we will do all the things

- can react do build and you can directly the push the code No right for that as well we need t make our code optimised and little perfect we can say

- NPM : - Node package manager, is it not correct
  it manages the package it doesnot stand for node package manager
  simply Its a package manager

- Simply a standard repository of all the package managers

- now just add npm to our project to the previous code
  adding the prevoious code to this folder as well and then we will add npm and see
- we will use jest for the test commands
