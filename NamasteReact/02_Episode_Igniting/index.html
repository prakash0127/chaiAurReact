      // // and it takes three parameters, first one is the element or tag here h1
      // // second is a Object
      // // third one will take the text what you want to print

      // // now for we need to append in root so our heading we need to put in root
      // // for that we need to create the root
      // // creating a element is from react that is core part
      // // and for root we need to use reactDOM means to append the element to our document
      // // so we need a root or we can say a tree to put to our document
      // // and now we have created a root for our react libarary and inside it we pass
      // // the place where we want to place our root
      // // root is the place where all the react code will run, our code will render inside the root
      // const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      // // now we need to render and inside we pass the heading
      // root.render(heading);
      // // react is doing all this things means appending the heading to div id root
      // // we can also write our code separately and attached to this index.html file
